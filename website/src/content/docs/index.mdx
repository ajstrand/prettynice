## What makes it pretty nice?

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Fully Full Stack" icon="seti:html">
        All responses start on the [server](/basics/server/).
        Pages load with all content and everything needed for interactivity.
        No fetch waterfalls.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Confident Components" icon="rocket">
        Interactive [components](/basics/client/), initialized on the server with auto-encoded data, type-checked at compile time.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Guidance and Guarantees" icon="seti:todo">
        Immutability, strong static types, carefully managed side-effects, and a helpful compiler thanks to [gren](https://gren-lang.org/)
	</Card>
	<Card title="Javascript just where you need it" icon="seti:javascript">
        Want to color outside the lines? Easy access to the full javascript ecosystem
        in the [browser](/next/client-js/) _and_ [node](/next/server-js/).
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
