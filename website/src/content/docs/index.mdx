## What makes it pretty nice?

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Fully Full Stack" icon="seti:html">
        Static HTML rendered on the [server](/basics/server/) alongside
        interactive [components](/basics/client/) that run in the browser.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Purely Functional" icon="star">
        Immutability, strong static types, and carefully managed side-effects thanks to [gren](https://gren-lang.org/)
	</Card>
	<Card title="Compile-time Guarantees" icon="seti:todo">
        Initialize your [components](/basics/client/) on the server with auto-encoded data, type-checked at compile time.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Javascript<br>if you need it" icon="seti:javascript">
        Want to color outside the lines? Easy access to the full js ecosystem
        in the [browser](/next/client-js/) _and_ in [node](/next/server-js/).
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
