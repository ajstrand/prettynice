Every request to your site begins on the server, which is defined in `server/src/Main.gren`.
If you generated your project with `prettynice init`, you'll have a basic router set up in that file.
Here I'll create one from scratch to help you understand what it's doing.

<Aside>
    If you aren't familiar with gren, it would be a good idea to read through [the book](https://gren-lang.org/book/) first.
    The rest of this guide will assume basic familiarity with gren and focus on the parts specific to prettynice.
</Aside>

Start with the module definition and necessary imports, exposing the required `main` function:

```elm
// server/src/Main.gren
module Main exposing (main)

import Node exposing (Environment)
import Prettynice.SimpleRouter as Router
import Prettynice.Request exposing (Request)
import Prettynice.Response as Response exposing (Response)
import Transmutable.Html as Html exposing (Html)
import Transmutable.Html.Attributes as Attr
```

I'm also exposing some types and creating some aliases for the long module names.

For details on modules, imports, exposing, and aliasing, check out [the modules section](https://gren-lang.org/book/syntax/modules/) of the gren book.

Next, let's add the router. This is where you will handle all incoming HTTP requests:

```diff lang="elm"
// server/src/Main.gren
  module Main exposing (main)
  
  import Node exposing (Environment)
  import Prettynice.SimpleRouter as Router
  import Prettynice.Request exposing (Request)
  import Prettynice.Response as Response exposing (Response)
  import Transmutable.Html as Html exposing (Html)
  import Transmutable.Html.Attributes as Attr
 
 
+ router : Request -> Response -> Cmd msg
+ router request response =
+     case request.path of
+         [] -> 
+             response
+                 |> Response.sendHtml
+                     { title = "My Website"
+                     , head = []
+                     , body = 
+                         [ Html.h1 [] [ Html.text "Welcome!" ]
+                         , Html.p [] [ Html.text "Cool page, huh?" ]
+                         ]
+                     }
+
+         _ ->
+             response
+                 |> Response.setStatus 404
+                 |> Response.sendText "Not found"
```

Prettynice will call this function every time someone makes a request to your site,
passing in a [request](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.Request#Request)
that holds information about the request, and a
[response](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.Response)
that you can use to respond to the request.

Here I'm pattern-matching on `request.path`, which is an array of strings representing each section of the URL path between `/`.
For example, if I wanted to match a path like `/admin/users`, I'd add a pattern like this:

```diff lang="elm"
  case request.path of
      [] -> 
          -- Handle root path: /
          ...
  
+     [ "admin", "users" ] ->
+         -- Handle /admin/users
+         ...
  
      _ ->
          -- Handle all other paths
          ...
```

The `_` pattern matches anything that was caught in a previous pattern.
I'm using that to respond with a 404 Not Found response.

I could also match on other parts of the [request](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.Request).
For example:


```diff lang="elm"
case request.method of
    GET -> 
        -- Handle GET requests
        ...

    POST ->
        -- Handle POST requests
        ...

    _ ->
        -- Handle all other requests
        ...
```

or a combination:

```diff lang="elm"
case request of
    { path = [] } -> 
        -- Handle root path for any method
        ...

    { path = [ "users" ], method = POST } ->
        -- Handle POST to /users
        ...

    ...
```

I can also capture dynamic parts of the url:

```diff lang="elm"
    [ "users", userId ] ->
        -- Handle paths like /users/123
        ...
```
