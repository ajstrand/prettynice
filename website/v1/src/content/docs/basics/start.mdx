import { Code, FileTree, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or higher.
2. Create a directory for your site:

   <Code code="mkdir mysite && cd mysite" frame="none" lang="bash" />

3. Set up the starter project template:

   <Code code="npx prettynice init" frame="none" lang="bash" />

4. Start the dev server:

   <Code code="npm run dev" frame="none" lang="bash" />

   and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

   The dev server will watch for changes and rebuild/restart automatically.

</Steps>

## Directory Structure

The important directories are:

<FileTree>
- client
  - src
    - Components
        - Counter.gren
- public
    - ...
- server
  - src
    - Main.gren
</FileTree>

* `Main.gren` is your [server](/basics/server/).
* `Counter.gren` is an example [client-side component](/basics/client/).
* `public` is where you can put your [static assets](/basics/assets/).

All of your server-side code lives under `server/` and will be compiled into a node application.

All of your client-side code lives under `client/` and will be compiled into a separate browser application, and will be served by the node application.
