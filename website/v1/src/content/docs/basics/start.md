You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or higher. Then:

```
mkdir mysite
cd mysite
npx prettynice init
```

Then you can start the dev server with:

```
npm run dev
```

and it will automatically rebuild and restart when source files change.

## Directory Structure

The important directories are:

```
├── client
│   └── src
│       └── Components
├── public
└── server
    └── src
        └── Main.gren
```
