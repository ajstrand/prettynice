import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Every request to your site begins in `server/src/Main.gren`.
If you generated your project with `prettynice init`, it will look something like this:

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Gen.Components.Counter
import Node exposing (Environment)
import Prettynice.SimpleRouter as Router
import Prettynice.Request exposing (Request)
import Prettynice.Response as Response exposing (Response)
import Transmutable.Html as H exposing (Html)
import Transmutable.Html.Attributes as A

main : Router.Program
main =
    Router.defineProgram
        { init = init
        , router = router
        }

init : Environment -> Router.Init
init env =
    Router.startProgram
        { host = "127.0.0.1"
        , port_ = 3000
        , env = env
        }

router : Request -> Response -> Cmd msg
router request response =
    case request.path of
        [] -> 
            response
                |> Response.sendHtml
                    { title = "My Website"
                    , head = [ linkStylesheet ]
                    , body = viewHomePage
                    }

        [ "hello", name ] ->
            response
                |> Response.sendText ("Hello, " ++ name)

        _ ->
            response
                |> Response.setStatus 404
                |> Response.sendText "Not found"

viewHomePage : Array (Html msg)
viewHomePage =
    [ H.h1 [] [ H.text "Welcome to my website!" ]
    , H.p [] [ H.text "I made this counter just for you." ]
    , Gen.Components.Counter.init { start = 0 }
    ]

linkStylesheet : Html msg
linkStylesheet =
    H.link [ A.rel "stylesheet", A.href "/styles.css" ]
```

If you aren't familiar with gren, it would be a good idea to read through [the book](https://gren-lang.org/book/) first.
The rest of this guide will assume basic familiarity with gren and focus on the parts specific to prettynice.

## Defining your Program

We start with a `main` function that defines a [`SimpleRouter`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.SimpleRouter)
using [`defineProgram`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.SimpleRouter#defineProgram):

```elm
main : Router.Program
main =
    Router.defineProgram
        { init = init
        , router = router
        }
```

It takes your `init` and `router` functions, which we will go over next.

<Aside>
    [`Prettynice.SimpleRouter`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.SimpleRouter).
    is good enough for many things, even complicated client-side interactivity.
    But if you need more server-side control - to read or write files, talk to
    a database, use custom javascript, or do other things that can affect the
    state of the world outside of your HTTP response - you can [define a full program](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice#defineProgram)
    instead. If you want more information on full programs, you can jump ahead
    to [The Elm Architecture](/next/tea/).
</Aside>

## Starting your Program

Your `init` function should call [`startProgram`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.SimpleRouter#startProgram).
This is where you define the host and port the server will listen on:

```elm
init : Environment -> Router.Init
init env =
    Router.startProgram
        { host = "127.0.0.1"
        , port_ = 3000
        , env = env
        }
```

## Routing Requests

The heart of your server is the router function.
Every request to your site will call this function,
with a [request](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.Request#Request)
holding information about the request, and a
[response](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.Response)
that you can use to respond to the request:

```elm
router : Request -> Response -> Cmd msg
router request response =
    case request.path of
        [] -> 
            response
                |> Response.sendHtml
                    { title = "My Website"
                    , head = [ linkStylesheet ]
                    , body = viewHomePage
                    }

        [ "hello", name ] ->
            response
                |> Response.sendText ("Hello, " ++ name)

        _ ->
            response
                |> Response.setStatus 404
                |> Response.sendText "Not found"
```

`request.path` is an array of strings. It holds the path portion of the URL split on `/`.
For example, requesting `127.0.0.1:3000/bowties/are/cool` would have a `request.path` of `["bowties", "are", "cool"]`.
Requesting the root path would have an empty array (`[]`).

You can also match on other things, like the [HTTP method](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/3.2.1/module/HttpServer#Method):

```elm
    case request of
        { method = POST, path = "/login" } -> 
```

Take a look at the [Request](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1.0.2/module/Prettynice.Request#Request)
record and see the pages on [pattern matching](https://gren-lang.org/book/syntax/pattern_matching/)
and [destructuring](https://gren-lang.org/book/syntax/destructuring/) in the gren book for help here.
