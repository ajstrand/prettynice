- [ ] Vite support:
  - [ ] `{client,server}/src/app.{js,ts}` entry points?
  - [ ] `client/assets` entry point for images, css, etc? how to reference in gren code?
  - [ ] use this for tailwind, bulma, scss, etc. with examples
- [ ] Update links in example READMEs to point to API docs where appropriate (e.g. linking to FieldType in component example)
- [ ] Audit dynamic component loading for XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Other security considerations? csrf?
- [ ] Doc site:
  - [ ] Think about versioning...
  - [ ] Link on github project settings and README
  - [ ] Link to relevant sections from the example READMEs
  - [ ] Link in the error message for failed props parsing
  - [ ] Flesh out gren guide if needed:
    - [ ] Arrays missing from pattern matching section, but I'm linking to this from my basic router example
    - [ ] Nothing about creating full applications (in browser or in node)
    - [ ] Good examples from lustre! https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/blob/main/pages/guide/02-state-management.md
  - [ ] Consider an interactive language tour ala tour.gleam.run
  - [ ] https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-blog ?
  - [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIPZlrCpwiE should probably be in the docs somewhere...
- [ ] Add a Dockerfile to the project template?
- [ ] Deployment example + docs.
  - [ ] sqlite vs postgresql (easy local dev vs easy management deployment?)
  - [ ] Fly.io vs Render.com
  - [ ] docker?
  - [ ] caddy as reverse proxy (and serving static)?
- [ ] Try devenv: https://devenv.sh/
- [ ] Offically announce the release:
  - [ ] blog.blaix.com
  - [ ] zulip
  - [ ] mastodon
  - [ ] discord
  - [ ] twitter?
- [o] Start migrating pencils.dev
- [ ] Add tests to the template app
- [ ] Add `__filename` to Node env, `splitPath` to FileSystem, and replace cli's `dirname` port call: https://gren.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/376306-ideas/topic/Node.20bindings.20to.20__dirname.3F/near/425878041
- [ ] `just publish-cli` that runs `build-cli` and validates similar to `gren package validate`
- [ ] Unit Tests. Especially Prettynice.Internal.Props
- [ ] Functional browser tests with playwright or similar
- [ ] Windows support: Remove POSIX path coupling from CodeGen (Shikensu's `*Posix` functions and hardcoded "/")
- [ ] Think about CSS post-processing:
  - [ ] tailwind? (meh)
  - [ ] bulma.io looks nice (no js!), maybe worth a UI package? look at https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/surprisetalk/elm-bulma/
  - [ ] look at <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ryannhg/css-in-elm>
- [ ] Think about JS bundling/transpiling:
  - [ ] vite? support importing .gren files?
  - [ ] swc?
- [ ] Cookies & Sessions
- [ ] Consider: what if I want traditional Flags from js? (right now prettynice controls this to do Props)
- [ ] [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) example app
- [ ] Redirect helpers?
- [ ] Handle multipart/form-data and file uploads
- [ ] Responses that align with the request content-type (e.g. 404 that returns html, string, or json depending on the request)
- [ ] Support records and custom types in component Props field types? See https://github.com/stil4m/elm-syntax for possible reference/example. Or worth waiting for gren-in-gren?
- [ ] Future ideas / Experiments:
  - [ ] component events that can trigger server-side messages: https://gist.github.com/blaix/5184b52b28f53c8019eca4a91e2fa868
  - [ ] HTM[X|Z] integration:
    - [ ] Form submissions? See https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/form
    - [ ] Server-side components?
    - [ ] toBackend/toFrontend messages?
    - [ ] If I just need to replace elements on the page: https://leanrada.com/htmz/
    - [ ] What about slow connections / failed js loading? See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzLGleT1yrY
- [ ] Speed up build step. Parallelize build tasks? (codegen has to happen before client/server builds)

## Open questions and future ideas

- [ ] No good way to get port and host from env vars for `Prettynice.startProgram`. Currently must be hard-coded or passed in via argv[].
- [ ] Is there any way to help with nested TEA? e.g. standalone TEA modules per route. See `examples/tea-modules`.
      Also see https://dev.to/jmpavlick/for-lack-of-a-better-name-im-calling-it-the-module-pattern-5dfi
- [ ] Is there anything that can be done about the duplication between Prettynice.gren and Prettynice.SimpleRouter.gren?
- [ ] Should there be a prettynice cli "serve" command?
    - [ ] Originally tried to do this but having trouble getting server's stdout to pass through the parent process
    - [ ] Is there any benefit over running the built server with node directly?
- [ ] Databases:
  - [ ] db-over-http once node HttpClient lands:
    - [ ] couchdb / pouchdb
    - [ ] AWS RDS Data API: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rdsdataservice/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteSql.html
    - [ ] sqlite-over-http? https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite
  - [ ] expand on ports/prisma example?
  - [ ] direct connection over tcp?:
    - [ ] kernel bindings for node's 'net' api
    - [ ] webcrypto for [passwords](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-password.html)? (joeybright working on this?)
    - [ ] example here: https://github.com/Asaye/PgDriverDemo (explanation here: https://info.deal-corner.com/post/311c1057-f94b-4b48-aadc-02de4ee5f0e0)
    - [ ] see this old package for a simpler reference than the current node pg package: https://github.com/creationix/postgres-js
  - [ ] See https://github.com/pghttp and elm-pghttp channel in incremental elm discord
- [ ] SSE? Websockets?
- [ ] SSR + hydration for components? Is there value?
- [ ] Emails? (Mario from Lamdera recommends https://postmarkapp.com/)
- [ ] Metrics? Prometheus (integrates with Caddy https://caddyserver.com/docs/metrics)?
