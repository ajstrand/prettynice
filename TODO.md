- [ ] Response.sendBytes
- [ ] Database example using ports?
- [ ] Handle TODO comments in code. Move things here or to github issues if they don't need to be addressed yet.
- [ ] Decouple build.sh from repo examples folder. Integrate into prettynice cli? (see joeybright/gren-args)
- [ ] Improve cli interface and server startup output (with charm.sh/gum?)
- [ ] Use HttpServer.requestInfo for request logging in the terminal.
- [ ] New project generator (charm.sh/gum?) with variants for:
  - [ ] Single file - Router
  - [ ] Single File - Program
  - [ ] Multi-file - Router
  - [ ] Multi-file - Program
- [ ] Document/Support (via generator?) trying the framework without an official package released
- [ ] **=== Pre-release for testing / feedback ===**
- [ ] Unit Tests
- [ ] Start migrating pencils.dev
- [ ] API Docs (reminder: use gren-doc-preview):
- [ ] **=== release 1.0 ===**
- [ ] Doc site. (including deployment). Flesh out gren guide with application info?
- [ ] Post:
  - [ ] blog.blaix.com
  - [ ] zulip
  - [ ] mastodon
  - [ ] discord
- [ ] Think about CSS post-processing:
  - [ ] tailwind?
  - [ ] bulma.io looks nice (no js!), maybe worth a UI package
- [ ] Think about JS bundling/transpiling:
  - [ ] vite? support importing .gren files?
  - [ ] swc?
- [ ] Experiment with HTMX integration / progressive enhancement:
  - [ ] Form submissions?
  - [ ] Server-side components?
  - [ ] toBackend/toFrontend messages?
- [ ] Cookies & Sessions
- [ ] Redirect helpers?
- [ ] [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) example app
- [ ] Handle multipart/form-data and file uploads
- [ ] Support more FieldTypes in Prettynice.Props (Array, Maybe, Records)
- [ ] Speed up build step. Parallelize build tasks? (codegen has to happen before client/server builds)
- [ ] Responses that align with the request content-type (e.g. 404 that returns html, string, or json depending on the request)

## Open questions and future ideas

- [ ] Is there anything that can be done about the duplication between Prettynice.gren and Prettynice.SimpleRouter.gren?
- [ ] Persistence? Database interaction? (Ports/Prisma, Gren Process API, TCP protocol, actual adapter?)
- [ ] ^ Keep an eye on the [elm->pgsql](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/elm-postgres-and-nothing-inbetween/9557/1) stuff by @damir (watch elm discourse and Incremental Elm discord).
- [ ] SSE? Websockets?
- [ ] SSR + hydration for components? Is there value?
- [ ] Emails? (Mario from Lamdera recommends https://postmarkapp.com/)
- [ ] Metrics? Prometheus (integrates with Caddy https://caddyserver.com/docs/metrics)?
