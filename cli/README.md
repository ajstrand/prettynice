# Prettynice CLI

Command line interface for Pretty Nice framework.
Currently only responsible for the build step, but may expand to things like generators, starting the server, or more.

`bin/index.js` is a node app, built from the gren files in `src/`

Build from the root of this repo with `just build-cli`

Will be published as an npm package. See `package.json`.
