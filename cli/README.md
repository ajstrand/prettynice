# Prettynice CLI

`bin/index.js` is a node app, built from the gren files in `src/`

Currently it's only responsible for building the app.
May expand this to running the server, generators, etc.

Build from the root of this repo with `just build-cli`

Will be published as an npm package. See `package.json`.
