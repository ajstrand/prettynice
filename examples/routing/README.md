# Routing Example

This is an example of routing different paths to different response.
It is pretty basic for now.
For an example of routing to a full TEA-style module, see [`examples/tea-modules`](/examples/tea-modules).

See [`server/src/Main.gren`](server/src/Main.gren).

```
npm install
npm start
```
