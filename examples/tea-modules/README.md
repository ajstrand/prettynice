# TEA Module Routing Example

This is an example of routing a request to a module with its own [TEA](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)-style init/update cycle.
The wiring is done manually. There's nothing special in Prettynice for this (yet?).

See [`server/src/Main.gren`](server/src/Main.gren).

```
npm install
npm start
```
